This application seeds "products" collection data to mongodb database.

## Database seeder

Only ~100 products are added for the demo to keep repository size smaller but more items can be downloaded from [online fashion dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-dataset)

### After download
